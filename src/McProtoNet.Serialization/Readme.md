# McProtoNet.Serialization

**McProtoNet.Serialization** is a library designed to simplify the serialization and deserialization of Minecraft protocol data. It provides a powerful and flexible API for working with binary data specific to Minecraft, including:

- Processing data in BigEndian format (high byte forward), which complies with the specifications of the Minecraft protocol and eliminates the need for manual byte order control.

- Serialization and deserialization of specific data types such as VarInt, VarLong, UUID, and NBT (Named Binary Tag).

- Convenient methods for reading and writing structures, which makes it easier to work with low-level data.
